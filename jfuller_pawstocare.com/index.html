        <h2>Cats</h2>
        <p>Many cats suffer from allergies. Skin and ear infections are commonly the result of repeated allergic episodes. The
          doctor will show you how to clean the ears and prescribe the right medication if signs of an infection are present.
          Check your cat's ears and look for any signs of disease.</p>

        <h2>Birds/Exotics</h2>
        <p>Many exotic pets have specific requirements regarding heat, light, temperature and cage bedding. A veterinarian educated
          in exotic pet care will review your pet’s cage setup to help ensure that you are providing an appropriate environment
          for your pet’s specific species and keeping up-to-date on the latest product recommendations.</p>

        <p>A good physical exam includes taking the patient's temperature. Normal temperature for a dog varies between 101 and
          102.5 degrees; that's a bit higher than our normal temperature. Every so often a seemingly healthy pet tips off
          the veterinarian that something isn't quite right simply by having an elevated temperature.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">One critical step in helping to make Utah a no-kill state is providing residents with resources so they can avoid
          relinquishing their pets to shelters. In January of 2014, we opened a pet food pantry at the Best Friends Pet Adoption
          Center in Salt Lake City. The pet food pantry provides high-quality pet food to the pets of low-income residents.
          To receive pet food from the pantry, Utah residents must show proof of low-income (food stamp card, Medicaid card
          or proof of participation in a low-income assistance program). Due to high demand, qualifying low-income Utah residents
          who have pets may receive pet food once per quarter. Please note that we rely on donations to fill orders, which
          means our food levels vary. If available, we do attempt to accommodate one-time emergency requests.

        <h2>What are community cats?
          <span class="text-muted">See for yourself.</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Community cats (also known as feral, stray or free-roaming cats), are the most-at-risk animals in shelters throughout
          the U.S. In fact, 70 percent of the animals killed in shelters are cats. In 2016, 79 percent of the animals killed
          in Utah shelters were cats, which translates into approximately 6,300 cats killed in shelters throughout the state.
          Since community cats are at great risk of being killed if they enter shelters, Best Friends helps ensure that they
          do not end up there by organizing and operating humane trap/neuter/return (TNR) programs. Trap/neuter/return is
          a comprehensive management plan in which healthy community cats are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and then returned
          to their outdoor communities.

        <p class="lead">

          Spaying or neutering is one of the greatest gifts you can provide your pet, your family and your community, and it is critical
          in helping to make Utah a no-kill state. These routine medical procedures not only help prevent medical and behavioral
          problems from developing, they also help decrease the number of pets entering shelters and free up homes for other
          pets by preventing unwanted litters. By getting your pet spayed or neutered, you are doing your part to help Save
          Them All.
